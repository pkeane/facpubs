<h2>FAQ: Citations</h2>
	<ul id="help">
		<li>
		<a href="#0.1_">Who adds citations to my record and where do they come from?</a>
		<ul>
			<li>You can add, review, and edit entries in your digital publication record as needed.</li>
			<li>To help you get started, UT staff seeded your digital record with citations gathered during spring 2011 from your public CV or other publications list.</li> 
			<li>Since staff may have used multiple sources to seed your record, you may see some duplicate entries or other editorial issues.  Please review, correct, and  update your record as necessary.</li> 
		</ul>
		</li>
		
		<li>
		<a href="#0.1_">What <strong>types of citations</strong> belong in the Publications Manager?</a>
		<ul>
			<li>Cite all significant publications and other creative activities where appropriate.  Cite also works submitted for publication, but not works in progress, papers read before learned societies, invited papers, or lectures of a scholarly nature.<br/><br/> Examples of <strong>publications</strong> to cite may include:
			<ul>
				<li>Books, articles, reports, published conference proceedings</li> 
				<li>Chapters and other contributions, reviews, translations, edited works</li>	
			</ul>
Examples of <strong>creative activities</strong> to cite may include:
			<ul>
				<li>Software and instructional technologies, recordings, broadcasts </li>
				<li>Exhibitions, curatorships, screenings, installations, architectural designs</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Each citation should be a complete reference to a single work, independent of other citations or section labels.</li>
			<li>Include citations to reprints within the original citation where appropriate.</li> 
			<li>Omit citations to unpublished activities such as presentations and lectures.</li>
			<li>Group citations using section labels.  These provide a visual convenience rather than machine-readable citation types.
		</ul>
		</li>

		<li>
		<a href="#0.1_">What counts as <strong>peer reviewed</strong>?</a>
		<ul>
			<li>Use the <strong>peer reviewed</strong> flag to indicate works published in or accepted to a peer-reviewed or refereed journal or venue as understood in your discipline or field.
			</li>
			<li class="ital">Note that, while seeding your digital publication record, staff marked as peer reviewed only those citations explicitly labeled 'peer reviewed' or 'refereed' in your CV or publications list.
			</li>
		</ul>
		</li>

		<li>
		<a href="#0.1_">What items should I mark as <strong>creative work</strong>?</a>
		<ul>
			<li>Use 'creative work' to tag entries that describe non-publication-oriented <strong>creative activities</strong> such as performances, screenings, or applications of technologies like those common in academic units in performing and fine arts and communications. Use 'creative work' to tag non-publication entries that describe <strong>activities</strong> such as performances and screenings or <strong>instructional technologies</strong> like web sites. Performing and Fine Arts or Communication.<br />
			    <strong>Examples include:</strong>
			<ul>
				<li>A screenplay, musical score, or architectural design</li>
				<li>A dance performance, art exhibition, or film screening</li>
				<li>A TV or radio broadcast, or internet podcast  </li>
				<li>Software, web sites, or instructional materials</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li>The creative work designation may be used administratively to 
			    differentiate between types of scholarly works in your record and to correctly import your 
			    citations into the digital Faculty Activity Report.

			</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		
		<li>
		<a href="#0.1_">How does the Pubs Manager <strong>format citations</strong>?</a>
		<ul>
			<li>Citations are stored as plain text. Text formatting such as underlined or bolded text is not available.</li>
			<li>Most special characters such as math and chemical symbols, superscripts and subscripts, and non-English characters are available. Our database uses UTF-8 encoding.</li>
			<li>You may use any citation formatting system (MLA, APA, etc) that you wish.  Your previously imported citations may have been modified slightly to ensure citation completeness.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		
		<li>
		<a href="#0.1_">Can my citations contain <strong>additional information</strong> such as annotations or abstracts?</a>
		<ul>
			<li>Additional information, such as reprint details, citation counts, and annotations may be included in the citation text if desired. These details will be displayed as part of the citation, and will be included when your citations are imported into the digital Faculty Activity Report.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		
		<li>
		<a href="#0.1_">How do I indicate that a work is <strong>not yet published</strong>?</a>
		<ul>
			<li>If a citation represents a work in the process of being published or released, you may indicate so within the citation text with an appropriate term such as "pending" or "under review".</li>
			<li>For works pending publication, leave the four-digit year field blank or fill in the anticipated year of publish.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		
		<li>
		<a href="#0.1_">What does it mean to <strong>certify</strong> my record?</a>
		<ul>
			<li>Certification indicates that your record of citations in the Pubs Manager is complete as of the date certified.</li> 
			<li>Some administrative uses of your records may require that your record is certified, so that your citations are considered in their full context.</li>			
			<li>It is up to you to regularly update your record - we recommend at least once a semester, especially before the annual FAR is submitted.</li>		</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>

<h2>Sections</h2>
	<ul id="help">
		<li>
		<a href="#0.1_">Who adds sections to my record and where do they come from?</a>
		<ul>
			<li>Sections that are already in your record were copied from your collected CV or publication source, if available.</li> 
			<li>If you see duplicated section names or other oddities, it probably means that there were multiple sources for your citation record. Feel free to edit these as needed.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>				

		<li>
		<a href="#0.1_">Do I have to use the <strong>provided sections</strong> or <strong>standardized categories</strong>?</a>
		<ul>
			<li>There are no required or "standard" sections.  Sections should be used to organize your citations in any way that makes sense to you.</li>
			<li>Please note that section headers are for organization only, and don't contribute semantically to the citations themselves. Please edit your citations to reflect important information, such as authorship roles.</li>
		</ul>

		</li>
		
		<li>
		<a href="#0.1_">What is the <strong>uncategorized</strong> section?</a>
		<ul>
			<li>The uncategorized section is the system default for citations that have not been placed in one of your sections.  Citations imported through the File Uploader will appear in the uncategorized section.</li>
			<li>The uncategorized section can't be renamed or sorted in the Sections tab.  Edit the uncategorized citation or use the "move all" feature in the section header to place them in a section of your own.</li>
		</ul>

		</li>
	</ul>
	
	
<h2>Uploading Files</h2>
	<ul id="help">		
		<li>
		<a href="#0.1_">When should I use the File Upload option?</a>
		<ul>
			<li>Uploading a file is not necessary, but it can speed up the process of adding citations. You may upload as many files as you like. We recommend a file upload when you have:
			<ul>
			        <li>a recent record of your citations available in pdf or doc format</li>
				<li>a large number of citations to add to your record</li> 
			</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		
		<li>
		<a href="#0.1_">Will the File Upload replace or update the citations already in my record?</a>
		<ul>
			<li>Nope! Uploading a file and importing citations only <strong>adds</strong> citations to your record: it won't replace any citations, even duplicates.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
	
<h2>Using your Record</h2>
	<ul id="help">
				
		<li>
		<a href="#0.1_">How visible is my record?</a>
		<ul>
			<li>Your record in the Pubs Manager is protected by your EID login, and is visible only to you and UT administrators that have been granted access.</li>
			<li>Because of the EID password protection, your Pubs record will not be accessible by search engine indexes.  To make your record available to search engines, include the "share my record" link (located in the <strong>File Upload</strong> tab) on your faculty page or personal website.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		
		<li>
		<a href="#0.1_">How to download or share your record</a>
		<ul>
			<li>To access a plain-view list of your record for printing or sharing, go to the <strong>File Upload</strong> tab and click on the "share my record" link. You may print this page from your browser or copy & paste the text into a text editor.</li>
			<li>This "share my record" url may be accessed without an EID. To make your record accessible to search engines, include the url on a publically accesible page, such as your faculty profile or personal website.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		
		<li>
		<a href="#0.1_">How to use citations to complete the Annual Faculty Activity Report</a>
		<ul>
			<li>When UT switches to a digital FAR system (the move is planned for the 2012-2013 reporting year), the FAR application will automatically import the citations from your Pubs Manager record. You will have the opportunity to edit or add to the imported citations as needed.</li>
			<li>Keeping your Pubs record up-to-date will simplify the FAR reporting process later.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
