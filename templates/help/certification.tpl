<h2>About: Certification</h2>

<p><strong>Certification</strong> indicates that your record is a complete 
   representation of your scholarly works as of the date of certification.</p> 
   
<p>Some administrative uses of your records may require that your record is 
   certified, so that your citations are considered in their full context.</p>

<p>You may access and update your record and renew the date of certification 
   at any time. We recommend updating once a semester, especially before the 
   annual Faculty Activity Report is due.</p> 
<p>All citations must be marked as "reviewed" for your record to be certified.</p>
