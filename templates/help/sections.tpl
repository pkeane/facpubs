<h2>Sections</h2>
<p>
  Use sections to organize your citations in any way you see fit.  There are no standardized or 
  required sections. Existing sections have been taken from your CV or other 
  publication list where possible.
</p>

<p>
  The "uncategorized" section is the default section title for unsorted citations. 
</p>

  <h3>Working with Sections:</h3> 
  <ul>
      <li>Add, remove, and edit sections in the Sections tab.</li>
      <li>To move a citation to another section, click on <em>edit</em> next to the citation text.</li>  
      <li class="tealed">To move all citations in a section, use the <strong>change sections</strong> tool in the section header.</li>
  </ul>
