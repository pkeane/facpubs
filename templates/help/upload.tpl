<h2>About Uploading Files</h2>

<p class="goto"><a href="faculty/{$fac->eid}/assistance">Click here</a> 
   to go to the File Uploader</p>
   
<p>If you have a large number of <strong>new</strong> citations to add to your record, 
   it may be faster to use the File Uploader than to add them individually.</p>  

<p>With the File Uploader, you can upload a <strong>.doc</strong> 
   or <strong>.pdf</strong> file that contains your citations 
   (such as your CV), select the citations you want to add to your 
   record, and import them all at once.</p>

<p>If you are using the uploader but there are already some 
   citations in your record, look for duplicates - 
   the File Uploader only imports citations; it doesn't check 
   them against your current record.</p>
